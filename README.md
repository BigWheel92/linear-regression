# linear-regression

1. An implementation of linear regression algorithm. Two classes of linear regression have been implemented one class uses gradient descent and the other class uses the normal equation. Both models are available in Model.py file.

2. Two datasets have been used for experimentation using linear regression. The two datasets are available in ex1data1.txt file and ex2data2.txt file, respectively. 

3. The dataset in ex1data1.txt file is about profit prediction of an outlet. The ﬁrst column is the population of a city and the second column is the proﬁt of an outlet in that city. A negative value for proﬁt indicates a loss.

4. The dataset in ex1data2.txt is about house prediction. The ﬁrst column is the size of the house (in square feet), the second column is the number of bedrooms, and the third column is the price of the house.
